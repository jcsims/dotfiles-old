;;; threatgrid.el --- Helper functions for working at Threatgrid

;;; Commentary:
;; Two main helper functions for git + threatgrid.  `preq` will convert
;; an issue to a pull request for you, and `tg-weekly-work-report`
;; will generate a markdown list of the PRs assigned to you that have
;; been merged in the last 8 days.

;; Github API docs:https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.9/v3/

;; There are a few dependencies:
;; - ghub
;; - magit
;; - dash

;; Configuration:
;; - Make sure you set the `tg-gh-username` var
;; - Set git config for ghub:
;;    [github "github.threatbuild.com"]
;;       user = <username>
;; - Configure auth for ghub: https://github.com/magit/ghub#github-enterprise-support
;;; Code:

(require 'magit-git)
