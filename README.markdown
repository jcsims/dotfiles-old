## dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They've grown organically over time, so use at
your own risk - I'm not responsible for helping you out!

## install

Everything just needs to be symlinked into your home directory. You
can do this by hand, or use
[`rcm`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm). The initial link (and
susequent checks) take a good bit of time (a couple minutes,
probably), because `rcm` currently checks _every_ file in a directory,
and the emacs and vim directories have many files.
