## dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They've grown organically over time, so use at
your own risk - I'm not responsible for helping you out!

## install

Everything just needs to be symlinked into your home directory. The
`bootstrap` script handles this fairly well, but doesn't handle
overwriting links.
